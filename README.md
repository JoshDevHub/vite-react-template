# Vite React Template

My template for bootstrapping a react project using vite.

## How to Use

Clone and run `npm install`.

## Packages

Very basic setup, but I expect to evolve it some in the future. Currently the following packages are installed and configured by this template:
- React
- TailwindCSS
- eslint
- svgr
